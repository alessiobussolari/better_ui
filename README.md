### General Components

## Overview

Better UI is a Rails gem that provides a collection of reusable UI components built with ViewComponent and Tailwind CSS. It features a unified design system with consistent theming and comprehensive form handling capabilities.

Key features:

- **TailwindCSS Only**: Pure Tailwind approach with no custom CSS/SCSS files

- **Unified Input System**: Single text component handles 14+ input types (text, email, password, number, date, time, etc.)
- **Interactive Documentation**: Built-in Lookbook integration with live previews
- **Helper System**: Rails-friendly helpers with form builder integration
- **Consistent Theming**: 9 standard themes (default, white, red, rose, orange, green, blue, yellow, violet)
- **Flexible Sizing**: 3 standard sizes (small, medium, large) with 5 border radius options
- **Accessibility**: Components designed with accessibility best practices

For more detailed information, see the [components documentation](COMPONENTS.md).

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem "better_ui"
```

For development with Lookbook documentation:

```ruby
gem "better_ui"
gem "lookbook", group: :development
```

And then execute:

```bash
$ bundle install
```

## Setup

### 1. Mount the Engine (Optional)

If you want to access BetterUI's internal routes, mount the engine in your `config/routes.rb`:

```ruby
Rails.application.routes.draw do
  mount BetterUi::Engine => "/better_ui"
  # your other routes...
end
```

### 2. Setup Lookbook (Recommended for Development)

To access the interactive component documentation during development, mount Lookbook in your `config/routes.rb`:

```ruby
Rails.application.routes.draw do
  # Mount Lookbook only in development
  mount Lookbook::Engine => "/lookbook" if Rails.env.development?

  # your other routes...
end
```

**That's it!** BetterUI components and their previews are automatically available in Lookbook.

### 3. Include Tailwind CSS

Make sure your application includes Tailwind CSS, as BetterUI components rely on Tailwind classes. If you don't have Tailwind CSS installed, follow the [official Tailwind CSS installation guide](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/guides/ruby-on-rails).

## Usage

Better UI components can be used in two ways: direct instantiation or helper methods.

### Helper Methods (Recommended)

```erb
<%# Text input with validation %>
<%= bui_input_text(
  name: 'email',
  value: @user.email,
  type: :email,
  theme: :blue,
  size: :large,
  required: true
) %>

<%# Button with theme and size %>
<%= bui_button(
  'Submit Form',
  theme: :green,
  size: :large,
  type: :submit
) %>

<%# Card with content block %>
<%= bui_card(title: 'User Profile', theme: :white) do %>
  <p>User information content here</p>
<% end %>

<%# Form integration %>
<%= form_with model: @user do |form| %>
  <%= bui_input_text(name: 'name', form: form, required: true) %>
  <%= bui_input_text(name: 'email', type: :email, form: form) %>
  <%= bui_button('Save', type: :submit, theme: :blue) %>
<% end %>
```

### Direct Instantiation

```erb
<%# Direct component rendering %>
<%= render BetterUi::General::Input::Text::Component.new(
  name: 'username',
  type: :text,
  theme: :default,
  size: :medium
) %>

<%# Button component %>
<%= render BetterUi::General::Button::Component.new(
  'Click me',
  theme: :blue,
  size: :large
) %>
```

### Component Parameters

Each component supports various parameters for customization. Common parameters include:

Better UI is designed to be highly customizable while maintaining consistency:

1. **Theme Customization**: Modify component constants to change default styling
2. **Component Configuration**: Configure default options in `config/initializers/better_ui.rb`
3. **TailwindCSS Integration**: All styling uses TailwindCSS classes for maximum flexibility
4. **Component Extensions**: Extend existing components or create your own following the established patterns

### Styling Approach

Better UI uses a pure TailwindCSS approach with constants for maintainable styling:

```ruby
# Component constants define styling options
BUTTON_THEME_CLASSES = {
  default: 'bg-gray-100 text-gray-900 hover:bg-gray-200',
  blue: 'bg-blue-600 text-white hover:bg-blue-700',
  green: 'bg-green-600 text-white hover:bg-green-700'
}.freeze

BUTTON_SIZE_CLASSES = {
  small: 'px-3 py-1.5 text-sm',
  medium: 'px-4 py-2 text-base',
  large: 'px-6 py-3 text-lg'
}.freeze
```

### Theming System

All components support consistent theming:

- **9 Standard Themes**: default, white, red, rose, orange, green, blue, yellow, violet
- **3 Standard Sizes**: small, medium, large
- **5 Border Radius Options**: none, small, medium, large, full

For more detailed customization instructions, see [CUSTOMIZATION.md](CUSTOMIZATION.md).

You can create wrapper components or extend existing ones:

## Testing

Better UI components are thoroughly tested. You can run the test suite with:

```bash
bin/rails test
```

## Styling and Customization

BetterUI components use Tailwind CSS classes. You can:

1. **Override classes**: Pass custom classes via the `classes` parameter
2. **Extend components**: Create your own components that inherit from BetterUI
3. **Theme customization**: Modify Tailwind configuration for consistent theming

```erb
<!-- Add custom classes -->
<%= render BetterUi::General::Button::Component.new(
  label: "Custom Button",
  classes: "my-custom-class hover:scale-105"
) %>
```

## Browser Support

BetterUI components support all modern browsers that support:

- CSS Grid and Flexbox
- ES6+ JavaScript features
- Tailwind CSS
